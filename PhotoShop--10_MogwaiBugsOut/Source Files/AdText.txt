Volkswagen's unique construction keeps dampness out.	

	For years there have been rumors about
floating Volkswagens. (The photographer
claims this one stayed up for about
42 minutes).
	Why not?
	The bottom of the VW isn't like ordinary
car bottoms. A sheet of flat steel runs under
the car, sealing the bottom fore and aft.

	That's not done to make a bad boat out
of it, just a better car. The sealed bottom
protects a VW from water, dirt and salt.
All the nasty things on the road that eventu-
ally eat up a car.
	The top part of a Volkswagen is also
very seaworthy. It's pratically airtight. So
airtight that it's hard to close the door

without rolling down the window just a
little bit.
	But there's still one thing to keep in mind
if you own a Volkswagen. Even if it could
definitely float, it couldn't float indefinitely.
		So drive around the big pud-
	     dles. Especially if they're big
	     enough to have a name.
